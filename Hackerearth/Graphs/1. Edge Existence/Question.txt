Edge Existence
You have been given an undirected graph consisting of 
N
N nodes and 
M
M edges. This graph can consist of self-loops as well as multiple edges. In addition , you have also been given 
Q
Q queries. For each query , you shall be given 2 integers 
A
A and 
B
B. You just need to find if there exists an edge between node 
A
A and node 
B
B. If yes, print "YES" (without quotes) else , print "NO"(without quotes).

Input Format:

The first line consist of 2 integers 
N
N and 
M
M denoting the number of nodes and edges respectively. Each of the next 
M
M lines consist of 2 integers 
A
A and 
B
B denoting an undirected edge between node 
A
A and 
B
B. The next line contains a single integer 
Q
Q denoting the number of queries. The next Line contains 2 integers 
A
A and 
B
B denoting the details of the query.

Output Format

Print Q lines, the answer to each query on a new line.
